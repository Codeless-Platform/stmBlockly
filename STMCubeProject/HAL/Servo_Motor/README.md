Allows bluepill boards to control a variety of servo motors.
This library can control a great number of servos.  On the bleupill Due you can control up to 60 servos.


## Functionality

This library allows an bluepill board to control RC (hobby) servo motors. Servos have integrated gears and a shaft that can be precisely controlled. Standard servos allow the shaft to be positioned at various angles, usually between 0 and 180 degrees. 
Continuous rotation servos allow the rotation of the shaft to be set to various speeds
